## Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Metrics System
```python
# Episode-level metrics
episode_success_rate, episode_collision_rate, episode_length_mean/std

# Performance percentiles  
path_deviation_p50/p90/p95, accuracy_rate_50cm/1m/2m

# Training insights
action_magnitude_mean/std, exploration_rate, gradient_norms
```

### Intelligent Model Loading
```python
# Auto-detection of RecurrentPPO models
is_recurrent = "recurrent" in model_path.lower()
if is_recurrent and RECURRENT_PPO_AVAILABLE:
    model = RecurrentPPO.load(model_path, env=env)
    model._is_recurrent = True
```

### Robust Training Pipeline
- VecNormalize for observation/reward standardization
- Custom evaluation callback with episode metrics computation
- Comprehensive logging to CSV, TensorBoard, and Wandb
- Automatic checkpoint saving and best model tracking

## Demo Compatibility Preserved

### User Experience Unchanged
- Identical Streamlit interface with same model selection options
- Transparent handling of both SimpleLSTMPolicy and RecurrentPPO models
- Same visualization and metrics display functionality

### Hidden State Management
- Proper LSTM state initialization and maintenance during simulation
- Episode start detection for recurrent policy inference
- Graceful degradation if RecurrentPPO not available

## Training Workflow Enhanced

### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Using dedicated script
python train_lstm_recurrent.py --config configs/baseline_lstm.yaml --wandb

# Using convenience script  
./run_lstm_recurrent.sh --wandb --seed 42

# Using main training script
python src/drone_rl/train/train.py --config configs/baseline_lstm.yaml
```

### Configuration-Driven
```yaml
algorithm: RecurrentPPO
policy: MlpLstmPolicy
recurrent_kwargs:
  lstm_hidden_size: 256
  n_lstm_layers: 2
  shared_lstm: False
```

## Backward Compatibility Maintained

### Legacy Model Support
- Existing SimpleLSTMPolicy models continue to work
- Demo app automatically detects and loads legacy models
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Gradual Migration Path
- Can train new RecurrentPPO models alongside existing ones
- Model type detection prevents loading conflicts
- Clear documentation for migration process

## Performance Improvements Expected

### Better Sample Efficiency
